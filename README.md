차이점은 k8s가 아닌 Minikube 환경에서 진행합니다.

k3s vs Minikube

> It depends on your use case and requirements. Both K3s and Minikube are popular solutions for running a Kubernetes cluster locally, but they have different strengths and weaknesses.
>
>K3s is a lightweight and easy-to-install Kubernetes distribution that is optimized for resource-constrained environments. It is ideal for edge computing and IoT scenarios, as well as for testing and development purposes.
>
>Minikube, on the other hand, is a more feature-rich solution that is better suited for local development and testing. It supports a wide range of features and can be run on various hypervisors such as VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, and Hyper-V. Minikube also offers more options for configuring and managing the cluster.
>
>In summary, K3s is a better choice for small-scale production deployments and edge computing scenarios, while Minikube is better suited for local development and testing.
